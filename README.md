The Classification Theorem of Finite Simple Groups states that every finite simple group is either a member of 18 specific infinite families of simple groups, namely,

- cyclic groups of prime order,
- alternating groups of degree at least 5,
- 16 other infinite families known as the simple groups of Lie type,

or one of 26 specific groups called the "sporadic groups".
